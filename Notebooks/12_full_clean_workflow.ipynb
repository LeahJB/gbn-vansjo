Two methods are used to read in this lake data, depending on whether predictions are being generated for the historic period or the future. If the past period, then a pre-processed set of lake observations can be read in directly, with no missing years. If for a future period, then daily data need to be read in, and the processing is done here to aggregate this to seasonal.\n",

Also a different set of colour data (MOVAR data, not NIVA data) were used in the period 1999-2012 than are in the daily data read in, so the predictions will differ from those used in the hindcast stats and plots."
